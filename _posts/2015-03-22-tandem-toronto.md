There's no way I can pretend to myself my trip to Tandem was just taking a detour. Their fabulous little café is all the way in Downtown East, and frankly I just don't have any business there. It was no surprise, then, that this was a deliberate first visit to their store. 

It's a well-layed out café, not too large, but with plenty of space around the counter. They have about six tables in the back, and no WiFi, as far as I could tell. Apart from beans, they sell a cute collection of vintage stoneware and appliances that's worth having a look at.

The single origin I ordered was a Costa Rican coffee. 

I just can't get used to it, but drip coffee here is brewed in advance, as so often in the Toronto coffee scene. It was pumped into my mug from a thermos-flask. I know, these plastic joepumps seem the backbone of North-American coffee culture, and their presence is widespread and accepted. But I can't help wondering why. Why risk serving coffee that's been sitting for an hour or so? (To be fair, they also offer a two-cup Chemex for those drinking together.)

I haste to tell you that the drip coffee was just gorgeous. It was served in the company of a brief skecth of its aroma: "nice and tart". I love it when baristas do that; it's brilliant and kind to draw people's attention to the notable aspects of a coffee, priming their taste. The coffee was smooth and indeed fruity and tart. It had notes of grapefruit and cranberry and made for a splendid afternoon soother.  

I decided to try my luck by ordering a shot of espresso from their signature blend as well. It would be intense compared to the single origin, I was told. The mix was of Brazilian and Indonesian origin, and it indeed had the hints of dark chocolate and earthiness the blend suggests. An astringent lemongrass aroma stood out as well. The espresso was slightly over–sized---the volume of a small long black---but despite that, it kept up creamy and full.

One of the baristas told me they vary the beans they use for their espresso-based drinks regularly: sometimes the blend, sometimes their single origin. Given that Tandem works with several roasters (Pig Iron, Cut Coffee, Detour), and has a nice selection of beans lined up for retail, I expect this store to offer plenty of variation.
